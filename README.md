From the logistical point of view, the purpose of this assignment is twofold. On one hand,
I work with data.frames/tibbles and produce plots but now using the packages
"dplyr" and "ggplot2". Also start working with a more
complex file structure. 

In this assignment, we consider different ways to rank the NBA teams. From
simple rankings based on a given observed variable, to rankings based on derived indices like
efficiency (i.e. EFF) or any other composite index.
